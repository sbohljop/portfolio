# Critique By Design
The following graph represents the statistics of the women's world cup soccer teams from 1969 to 2020. The link for the following graph can be found [here](https://observablehq.com/@cassiead/cse-442-a2). The title of the graph I selected is "Total Goals Scored in International Competition While Home (1969-2020)".

I decided to pick this visualization because I am passionate about soccer, and the world cup is just around the corner, which made it an excellent choice to discuss. Usually, we associate soccer and sports with men. Still, I wanted to include an analysis of how women perform in this sport and the team leading throughout history. 

## Critique the visualization

Initially, I quickly analyzed the visualization and identified what impacted me the most. It was hard to grasp what the author intended with the graph. There were a lot of things going on at the same time. I noticed three charts in the exact visualization, but I needed help picking one that explained the author's intention most. Then I read the title, trying to figure out what the graph was about. I needed clarification because the title only related to some of the graphs displayed. On the other hand, I liked that the author used a bar chart to say frequencies, which is a very intuitive way to compare world cup teams. 

After the quick inspection, I used Stephen Few's guide to evaluate the visualization in more detail. This strategy helped me better understand what things could be improved from the graph by analyzing aspects of usefulness, engagement, intuitiveness, etc. That made me realize that another thing that needed to be more intuitive about the chart was the order of the bars. As you can see in the picture above, the values aren't sorted by importance, which makes it harder to associate and evaluate which team is better at scoring goals. Additionally, the use of three graphs isn't adding more information but needs to be clarified which one is more important and how they relate to each other. The objective of a chart is to reduce the work done by the user, digesting as much as possible the data presented. Furthermore, I realized that the name of the third graph needed to be more precise about the measured values. Finally, I felt the colors were overused, making it look like a rainbow chart.
