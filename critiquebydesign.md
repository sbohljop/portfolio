# Critique By Design
The following graph represent the statistics of the women's world cup soccer teams from 1969 to 2020. The link for the following graph can be found [here](https://observablehq.com/@cassiead/cse-442-a2). The title of the graph I selected is "Total Goals Scored in International Competition While Home (1969-2020)".

I decided to pick this visualization, because I am passionate about soccer, and the world cup being just around the corner, I felt like a good choice to discuss about it. Usually, we associate soccer and sports with men, but I wanted to include the analysis of how women perform in this sport and what are the team that have been leading throught history. 

## Critique the visualization

At the beggining, I quickly analyzed the visualization and identified what impacted me the most. I felt it was hard to grasp what the author was intending with the graph. There was a lot of things going on at the same time. I noticed that there were three graphs in the same visualization, I wasn't able to pick one that explained the most the author's intention. Then I went and read the title, trying to figure out what the graph was about. I was even more confused, becasue the title din0t related with all the graphs displayed. On the other hand, I liked that the author used bar chart to display frequencies, whihc is a very intutive way to compare world cup teams. 

After the quick inspection, I used the Stephen Few's guide to evaluate the visualization better and more detailed.
