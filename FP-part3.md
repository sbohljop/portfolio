# Final Project: Part 3

## Audience
The initial target audience I selected for the presentation is people between 25-40 who smoke tobacco or vape to reduce their stress levels in the US. Nevertheless, after conducting several interviews, I realized how important it is for parents to guide their kids and inform them about the harms of smoking tobacco or vaping. Many parents interviewed didn't know what vaping was and were impressed with how younger generations are becoming addicted. Additionally, some of them asked me to share to them my presentation so they could show the results to their kids. So I decided that the age range of my audience was going to be from 15-45.<br>
On the one hand, the final targeted groups will be smokers, and the objective is to help them quit by understanding why they are smoking, what their triggers are, and giving them the tools to stop doing so. On the other hand, the final target will also include younger generations or people that are curious about trying tobacco or vaping. The objective for the nonsmokers will be to inform them about the harmful effects of smoking on their health, preventing them from trying it and then getting addicted. Many young kids think smoking is incredible, especially if a friend is doing so. Still, they don't know that they can get addicted to nicotine, and getting out of that cycle is more complicated than preventing them from starting. <br>
Additionally, I received feedback that some of my graphs were very complex or hard to follow because there needed to be more information. So I adapted the presentation and charts to the audience, which is a non-technical audience. For example, I used pictogram charts related to counting persons so the viewer can tell how many persons out of 100 are smoking e-cigarettes instead of using percentages which is more challenging to visualize.
