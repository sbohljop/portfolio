# Final Project: Part 3

## Project Walkthrough: 

### Project Idea: 
I have always suffered from anxiety, so I need to find activities that relieve me of that feeling. There was a time when I smoked cigarettes and then vaped because I felt it reduced my stress. Every time I smoked, I felt relaxed, but it was a short-term relief, but after a few hours, the anxiety peaked, making me enter through a vicious cycle and dependent on nicotine. Throughout the years, I felt how unhealthy smoking was, I couldn't breathe properly, and my stress levels were at their highest. I started vaping because many companies marketed it as a healthier substitute for tobacco products. In the beginning, I began to feel better, but I began to smoke more frequently due to its ease. One day I realized how harmful these products are and stopped using them. My stress, anxiety, and health problems disappeared. So when I was thinking about making a storyboard, I first thought to share all the data available to conscious people about the harms of smoking any product. 

My main idea is to discuss the health problems related to smoking cigarettes, vapes, and tobacco products. I want to show everyone how many people take refuge in these products to stop feeling anxious, but what they do is prolong and amplify it. Additionally, I consider covering why most people start smoking and why they continue because it could help people identify their triggers and improve them. 

Even though we know smoking tobacco is harmful, many are unaware of how bad it is. According to Our World in Data, smoking tobacco is the number one cause of death by risk factors. I will cover all the health aspects of vaping and smoking tobacco and how the younger generations are incorporating nicotine into their lives.
At last, the objective of the presentation is to make conscious of the dangers of tobacco and nicotine and motivate those still addicted to them by showing what to do to stop the addiction cycle and what has helped millions. But after many interviews, I want to inform younger generations that even though e-cigarettes are better than tobacco, it is still very harmful to their health, and we don't know the side effects in the long run. 


### Data Sources
I primarily used data from [Centers of Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/index.htm). They have surveys, historical consumption of vape and tobacco, anti-smoking campaign, and consumption per state. The CDC is one of the most critical institutions in the U.S. for raising smoking awareness. They have several sources of information that were key to creating the storyboard. Additionally, I paired information with datasets such as the one displayed in [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/smoking). 

The first data I used was the statistics of deaths in the United States. I wanted to explore the risk factors causing more deaths and how that had changed over time. I investigated whether we are smoking more or less than before, if the consumers of e-cigarettes are higher than those who smoke tobacco, and the effects recorded for heavy vape smokers. Next, I explored the surveys the institutions have done to schools nationwide and understand why they smoke for the first time and why they are still smoking (click [here](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/surveys/index.htm) for the data). 

Finally, I researched the most efficient ways to leave nicotine cravings and addiction and interviewed ex-smokers about how they beat nicotine. This information helped me design the proposed and detailed call to action.

### Audience
The initial target audience I selected for the presentation is people between 25-40 who smoke tobacco or vape to reduce their stress levels in the US. Nevertheless, after conducting several interviews, I realized how important it is for parents to guide their kids and inform them about the harms of smoking tobacco or vaping. Many parents interviewed didn't know what vaping was and were impressed with how younger generations are becoming addicted. Additionally, some of them asked me to share to them my presentation so they could show the results to their kids. So I decided that the age range of my audience was going to be from 15-45.<br>
On the one hand, the final targeted groups will be smokers, and the objective is to help them quit by understanding why they are smoking, what their triggers are, and giving them the tools to stop doing so. On the other hand, the final target will also include younger generations or people that are curious about trying tobacco or vaping. The objective for the nonsmokers will be to inform them about the harmful effects of smoking on their health, preventing them from trying it and then getting addicted. Many young kids think smoking is incredible, especially if a friend is doing so. Still, they don't know that they can get addicted to nicotine, and getting out of that cycle is more complicated than preventing them from starting. <br>
Additionally, I received feedback that some of my graphs were very complex or hard to follow because there needed to be more information. So I adapted the presentation and charts to the audience, which is a non-technical audience. For example, I used pictogram charts related to counting persons so the viewer can tell how many persons out of 100 are smoking e-cigarettes instead of using percentages which is more challenging to visualize.

### Overall Project Summary
I split the creation of the storyboard into three parts: <br>
1. The story design, project outline, data sketches, and data collection.<br>
2. A draft of the storyboard and charts, wireframes, user research, and interviews.<br>
3. The final storyboard version and a summary of all the backstage work.<br>
 
#### Part 1
In the first part of the project, I came up with the idea of making a story about the harms of smoking tobacco or e-cigarettes on health, but first, I had to define what the viewer wants by reading the slide deck and what would be the call of action of the viewer. 
So I came up with the following idea: <br>
As a reader, I want to stop smoking tobacco or e-cigarettes to become healthier, reduce my anxiety, and live longer.
I can do this by understanding the relationship between nicotine and the levels of stress and how harmful smoking chemical substances is to our bodies.

Once the objective and the call to action were defined, I started working on the story arc of the presentation. The story arc would be the outline for the whole structure of the storyboard, so the data and graphs displayed impact the audience. 

Finally, I researched datasets for the graphs that would answer the questions stated in the story's objective. Once I had the information available, I drew sketches of what I wanted to visualize with that data. The valuable thing about sketching is that the application features do not restrict your creativity, so I decided to draw them on an iPad.

#### Part 2
In the second part of the project, I started plotting the graphs in Flourish to have an effective and fast visualization to show them in the interviews. Nevertheless, much of the data I got didn't have the structure needed for the visualizations. So I had to process data before uploading the data into Flourish. Once I had all the visualizations, I decided to use Shorthand to do the presentation because it is more creative and better appealing than other available platforms. Additionally, I can better transmit the message I want to the audience by using Shorthand. The application has templates and tools that will enable me to present an impactful story, including graphs, text, and statistics. 
After reading my first draft, I started with the first round of interviews to get feedback on my charts and presentations. I presented my storyboard to two CMU students and a friend from home. I designed. a script that helped me deliver the experiment better so I could get the best out of the interviewees' feedback. To identify the representative individuals to interview, I talked to people I knew who smoked cigarettes or vaped. I consider that someone smoked if they vaped or smoked for more than 100 days because there are non-frequent smokers. Being an active smoker is an essential part of the interview discovery because most of them, including myself when I used to smoke, do so because they are stressed or anxious.

After collecting all of the data, I realized that one of the most frequent comments I heard from the people was that I needed to include more information or statistics about why smoking vaping is bad for health. Most of them vaped or were thinking about switching from smoking tobacco to vaping because they felt it was healthier. Also, some graphs were complicated to follow, especially the ones with historical data. I made some changes to the presentation. There were many categories in the graph bars, so some recommended that I highlight the most important ones. They needed to figure out what to look at and what my intention was by including them. By changing the focus with color and bolding the name of the categories, I could attract the attention of the type I am interested in. Make some graphs about how unhealthy vaping is and the harm to the body. Even though there is scarce data about it, share some statistics to make the spectators even more aware of the dangers of vaping.
Finally, I did a second round of interviews and took the professor's and the TA's feedback. Some graphs were creative but needed more information to understand proportions; others took time to understand the intention of including them. So I modified several titles to help the viewer understand better what I wanted to highlight in the graphs and added color to the part I wanted to focus on. Finally, one of the best feedback I got in my second round of feedback was that my call of action was poor. I encouraged smokers to stop smoking, but I also should give a concrete action plan. I researched effective ways of quitting smoking, asked some psychologists about it, and interviewed old smokers about what worked for them.
