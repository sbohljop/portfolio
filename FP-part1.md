# Final Project: Part 1
## Outline
For my final project, I want to discuss the health problems related to smoking cigarettes, vapes, and tobacco products. I have always suffered from anxiety, so I need to find activities that relieve me of that feeling. Nevertheless, there was a time when I smoked cigarettes and then vaped because I felt it reduced my stress. Every time I smoked, I felt relaxed, but it was a short-term relief, but after a few hours, the anxiety peaked, making me enter through a vicious cycle and dependent on nicotine. Throughout the years, I felt how unhealthy smoking was, I couldn't breathe properly, and my stress levels were at their highest. I started vaping because many companies marketed it as a healthier substitute for tobacco products. In the beginning, I began to feel better, but I began to smoke more frequently due to its ease. One day I realized how harmful these products are and stopped using them. My stress, anxiety, and health problems disappeared. I want to show everyone how many people take refuge in these products to stop feeling anxious, but what they do is prolong and amplify it. I will cover all the health aspects of vaping and smoking and how the younger generations are incorporating nicotine into their lives. At last, I want to make consciousness of the dangers of tobacco and nicotine and motivate those that are still addicted tho them.  

As a reader, I want to stop smoking cigarettes, vape, or any tobacco products to become healthier, reduce my anxiety, and live longer.

I can do this by understanding the relationship between nicotine and the levels of stress and how harmful smoking chemical substances is to our bodies.

What I want to relate through my Story Arc is that at the beginning, I want to share that even though we know smoking tobacco is harmful, many are unaware of how bad it is. When we think about death, most people believe nothing will happen to them, but according to [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/smoking), smoking tobacco is the number two cause of death by risk factor. Then I want to show the viewer the trend of smoking tobacco. Is it increasing o decreasing? Are more younger generations becoming addicted to smoking than before? Then I will cover vaping trends and how many estimated people are vaping. After that, I will cover why most people start smoking and why they continue. In my experience, I noticed that the first time I smoked was because I was curious, and a friend offered it to me. But I continued because of anxiety, and I needed something to calm and relax me. But I will show why this is mistakenly thought. Finally, I will show what to do to stop the addiction cycle and what has helped millions of people closing with a phrase that raises awareness or call to action. 

## Initial Sketches

In the story I want to share I want to use graphs that impact the viewers by digesting in an intuitive and easy way the facts about why is it bad to smoke. 

The first visualization will be a horizontal bar hart that indicates how dangerous smoking is

The second graph will be a historical line chart showing how smoking habits have been dropping but are currently increasing. Additionally, I will add the consumers of e-cigarettes and if the percentage of people who vape is higher than the ones that smoke tobacco.

Finally, I will show why people smoke. Most people smoke because they are anxious and want to reduce their anxiety, but they don't know that they are actually prolonging it.

## The Data
I will primarily use the data from [Centers of Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/index.htm). They have surveys, historical consumption of vape and tobacco, anti-smoking campaign, and consumption per state. Additionally, I will pair information with datasets such as the one displayed in [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/smoking). 

The first data I will be using is the statistics of deaths in the United States. I want to explore the risk factors causing more deaths and how that has changed over time. Additionally, I want to check if the states have more professionals with stressful jobs and are related to people that smoke more or less. Then, I will check the historical trend of smoking tobacco and vaping. I want to explore whether we are smoking more or less than before if the consumers of e-cigarettes are higher than those who smoke tobacco, and the effects recorded for heavy vape smokers. Next, I will explore the surveys the institutions have done to schools and understand why they smoke for the first time and why they are still smoking (click [here](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/surveys/index.htm) for the data). Finally, I will incorporate strategies that have helped people quit smoking into the analysis. 

## Method and Medium
I will do the presentation using Shorthand because I can better transmit the message I want to the audience. The application has templates and tools that will enable me to present an impactful story, including graphs, text, and statistics. I will work the charts in Tableau and Flourish. I made the sketches so I didn't bias the main message I wanted to transmit but depending on the functionalities of the latter application, I will decide which one to pick. For example, I will work in  Flourish when I need fast and effective visualizations, but in Tableau, when I need more detailed and complicated charts.
