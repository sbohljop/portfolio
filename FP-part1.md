# Final Project: Part 1
## Outline
For my final project, I want to discuss the health problems related to smoking cigarettes, vapes, and tobacco products. I have always suffered from anxiety, so I need to find activities that relieve me of that feeling. Nevertheless, there was a time when I smoked cigarettes and then vaped because I felt it reduced my stress. Every time I smoked, I felt relaxed, but it was a short-term relief, but after a few hours, the anxiety peaked, making me enter through a vicious cycle and dependent on nicotine. Throughout the years, I felt how unhealthy smoking was, I couldn't breathe properly, and my stress levels were at their highest. I started vaping because many companies marketed it as a healthier substitute for tobacco products. In the beginning, I began to feel better, but I began to smoke more frequently due to its ease. One day I realized how harmful these products are and stopped using them. My stress, anxiety, and health problems disappeared. I want to show everyone how many people take refuge in these products to stop feeling anxious, but what they do is prolong and amplify it. I will cover all the health aspects of vaping and smoking and how the younger generations are incorporating nicotine into their lives. At last, I want to make consciousness of the dangers of tobacco and nicotine and motivate those that are still addicted tho them.
