## User research and interviews

### Research Protocol

In the user interviews, I am interested in finding several aspects of my presentation:

- An essential part for me is to know if the story I am telling has a logical flow and if the viewers understand it easily. 
- Get feedback about the presentation's engagement and if it has a clear and final call to action. 
- Test the visualizations by understanding if the interviewers get the message I am trying to transmit to them.
- Improvement opportunities in the slides. (Too much text, tedious, confusing, etc.)

**Target audience you hope to reach with your story:** People between 25-40 that smoke tobacco or vape as a way to reduce their stress levels.

**Your approach to identifying representative individuals to interview:** To identify the representative individuals to interview, I talked to people I knew who smoked cigarettes or vaped. Additionally, I consider that someone smoked if they vaped or smoked for more than 100 days because there are non-frequent smokers. Being an active smoker is an essential part of the interview discovery because most of them, including myself when I used to smoke, do so because they are stressed or anxious. 

### Script

#### Introduction
"Hello, my name is Stephano Bohl, and I am currently studying for a master's degree at Carnegie Mellon. I am making a presentation about the effects of smoking and why people do it. My goal is to get feedback on the pitch deck I have made to understand if the logical flow of the presentation makes sense and if something is confusing about the graphs or the slides. The answers from the interview will be anonymous and will not take much of your time. Feel free to be honest, and know there aren't wrong answers."

#### Main Section

**Ask:** "How old are you? Have you been smoking vape or cigarettes for the past 100 days? Which one do you smoke? What are the main reasons you smoke?" 

"As you can see, I have designed the storyboard. This slide deck is only a sketch of what I will be presenting, so there may be some slides without being completed, but the logical structure of the presentation is there. Feel free to stop me if you need help understanding a slide or think something needs to be clarified, think something makes sense or anything that you feel needs to be more interesting. " 

As the interviewed person goes through the storyboard: encourage them to follow their process and try not to bias the interview. Let them inspect the graphs and share with you what they understand about them. 

Let them finish the whole presentation and ask them the following questions:
1. "Ok. After reviewing the presentation, what message was transmitted by the storyboard?"
2. "What was the story told or the logical flow of the presentation?"
3. "Were you captivated by the presentation?"
4. "Did you had a hard time understanding the graphs? Were they clear enough?" 
5. "Do you understand better why you smoke or what your triggers are?" 
6. "Are you feeling like quitting smoking?" 
7. "Who do you think the presentation should be shown to? Who should it be the target audience?"
8. "What other questions do you have about the slide deck, if any?"

Finally, wrap up the interview by giving thanks for their time and asking them if they have any questions for you. 

#### Findings

- One of the most frequent comments I heard from the people is that I needed to include more information or statistics about why smoking vape is bad for health. Most of them vaped or were thinking about switching from smoking tobacco to vaping because they felt it was healthier. 
- Include a different picture more related to what I am talking about in the slides.
- Some slides had too much text, which distracted him. Something can be said shorter and have more robust and impactful effects on viewers.
- The graphs are clear and connect the ideas of why people smoke. Many of them were amazed by how many people died from smoking tobacco. Nevertheless, they noticed that it was on nominal numbers and not per capita, so that the growth may be for the population.   

#### Changes Proposed

d. the findings from your interviews; and 
e. changes you plan on implementing to your visualizations next week to address the issues identified.
