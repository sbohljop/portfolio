## User research and interviews

### Research Protocol

In the user interviews, I am interested in finding several aspects of my presentation:

- An essential part for me is to know if the story I am telling has a logical flow and if the viewers understand it easily. 
- Get feedback about the presentation's engagement and if it has a clear and final call to action. 
- Test the visualizations by understanding if the interviewers get the message I am trying to transmit to them.
- Improvement opportunities in the slides. (Too much text, tedious, confusing, etc.)

**Target audience you hope to reach with your story:** People between 25-40 that smoke tobacco or vape as a way to reduce their stress levels.

**Your approach to identifying representative individuals to interview:** To identify the representative individuals to interview, I talked to people I knew who smoked cigarettes or vaped. Additionally, I consider that someone smoked if they vaped or smoked for more than 100 days because there are non-frequent smokers. Being an active smoker is an essential part of the interview discovery because most of them, including myself when I used to smoke, do so because they are stressed or anxious. 

### Script

#### Introduction
"Hello, my name is Stephano Bohl, and I am currently studying for a master's degree at Carnegie Mellon. I am making a presentation about the effects of smoking and why people do it. My goal is to get feedback on the pitch deck I have made to understand if the logical flow of the presentation makes sense and if something is confusing about the graphs or the slides. The answers from the interview will be anonymous and will not take much of your time. Feel free to be honest, and know there aren't wrong answers."
