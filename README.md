# Portfolio: Story Telling with Data
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!

## About me
Currently I am a MISM-BIDA student at Carnegie Mellon. I have four years of experience as a Data Scientist and I am always eager to learn new things. 

## What I hope to learn
I want to master the technique of telling stories with data by simplifying the insights and analysis, being able to explain them in an effective and easy way to non-technical and technical viewers. I want to be able to generate graphs that make an impact on people.
