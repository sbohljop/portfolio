# Radial Hierarchy: Government Debt-to-GDP Ratio

The first graph compares the debt-to-GDP proportion of the countries in 2019, ordering them from the lowest to the largest. The second graph includes information from 1995-2019. It is more focused on the trend of the debt-to-GDP percentage throughout all the years for each country. The third graph contains data from 1995-2019, which can be filtered to analyze each year and identify what countries had the highest debt-to-GDP ratio during those years. 

The second graph doesn't compare the countries for each year. Still, it uses grids to separate the analysis for each country and depict information about the tendency of the debt-to-GDP ratio. Nevertheless, the first and the third are more focused on comparing the values of all the countries. The main differences between the first and third graphs are that in the third one, you can filter the year you want to compare the countries, and the radial graph highlights the highest country's debt-to-GDP ratio by positioning it first, and the bar is higher than the other ones.

I chose the radial plot because it is an easy and interactive way to compare the country's debt-to-GDP ratio, clearly indicating the highest ones. I was also trying to find a graph that would include the time as a variable, but managing single colors to highlit specific points in the chart was restricted. So instead of using multiple colors, that could confuse the viewer. I selected a graph that could depict the countries in time that had the highest debt-to-GDP ratio cleanly and efficiently.
